## LFRM

This is my effort to reproduce Miller et al's (2009) nonparametric latent 
feature relational model (LFRM) and apply it to a Twitter dataset limited to
the members of the 113th US Congress.

### Munging

Miller tests LFRM on a NIPS authorship dataset produced by Globerson et al
(2007). That set is available [here.](http://ai.stanford.edu/~gal/)

I've munged this data to reproduce Miller's NIPS link matrix.
